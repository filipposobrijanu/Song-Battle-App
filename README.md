# 💿 Yeat Song Battle App

A **web-based song-ranking application** where users participate in a head-to-head voting system to determine the ultimate winner among a curated selection of songs by the artist Yeat. The app presents users with **two randomly selected tracks** from Yeat’s discography—spanning albums, EPs, and singles—and prompts them to choose their preferred song in each matchup. Through iterative rounds of voting, the system progressively narrows down the selections, ultimately crowning a **fan-favorite track** based on collective user decisions. Built with **modern web technologies**, the app ensures a seamless, interactive experience while dynamically tracking and updating results in real-time. Ideal for fans looking to engage with Yeat’s music in a fun, competitive format, the platform offers both entertainment and insight into popular preferences within his catalog.
